> Tool to format and easily read backup/export files from good the old Microsoft MSN Messenger ðŸ‘´.

You are browsing through some old personal backup archives and stumble upon an _"msn"_ or _"msn chats"_ folder... your mind recall things about wonderful times and people of when the Internet and social networks were still a fun place... you think _"OMG that happened more or less 15 years ago! I was such a different person..."_.

Now you are curious to read that old messages and have fun of your younger self but then when you open the folder you find a bunch of `.xml` files, it's not difficult to open them, but between all those tags and data is difficult to properley read the messages text... and this is exactly what this tool is about!

Just copy & paste the XML content in this tool and have your old chat readable again in modern chat UI!
